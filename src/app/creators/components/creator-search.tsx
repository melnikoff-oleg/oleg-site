   *
   * This REVEALS, it does not fetch. All 50 arrived with the first answer, so
   * reaching the bottom cannot spin, cannot fail and costs no second embedding.
   * 800px of rootMargin means the next card exists before the last one has been
   * read.
   *
   * The sentinel is only in the tree while there is more to show, so the observer
   * stops existing at the cap rather than sitting there firing.
