Create inbox/ (where I dump anything, unsorted), projects/ (things with a finish line), areas/ (ongoing parts of my life), wiki/ (notes you write and maintain), archive/ (done or dead), and tmp/ (scratch). Write CLAUDE.md that says: I dump raw thoughts, you do the filing, linking and summarizing; what each folder is for and what you may write where; always link notes with [[wikilinks]]; never rename a file without updating every link to it; no spaces in filenames; scratch goes in tmp/. Every note you create gets frontmatter with type, description, created, tags. Create Home.md as a dashboard listing my active projects and recent notes, and keep it current. Add two slash commands in .Claude/commands: /inbox to file everything in inbox/ into the right place, and /today to make a daily note. Then commit.`;

          <p>
            And it is the only cost: the second brain itself adds nothing on

            with Claude Code.

            Talk to it with your voice. A dictation tool makes dumping five
            minutes of context painless, and context is what makes the answers
            good.
          </p>
          <p>
            The win is compounding memory: every task leaves facts behind, and
            the next task starts from them. After a few weeks it knows your
            company, your documents and your plans, and you stop repeating
            yourself.

            Keep big, long-running projects in their own folders outside the
            vault; tell the second brain where they live so it can read them
            when needed. Everything else, from experiments to 30-minute jobs,
            belongs inside.
