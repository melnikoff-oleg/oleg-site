    q: "Do I need to know how to code to use Claude Code for marketing",
    a: "No. You make a folder, paste two API keys into a text file, and type instructions in plain English. I dictate most of mine by voice. The one genuinely new thing is being willing to open a terminal, and that is a smaller barrier than it feels like from the outside.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why not just use ChatGPT for this",
    a: "Because a chat window cannot scrape your competitors' ads, generate the images, and hand you a finished page. The difference is not the writing quality, it is that Claude Code has your files and can call other services, so a task ends with an artifact on disk rather than text you then have to go and act on.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does this cost to run",
    a: "A Claude plan at $20 a month, plus what you spend on scraping and image generation. All five use cases in the video cost about $3 of API credit between them. I spend a few hundred a month on Apify, but that is running client work daily, not trying this out.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can Claude Code scrape Instagram or facebook ads directly",
    a: "No, and trying is the most common way to waste an afternoon. Those platforms actively block scraping, so a direct attempt half works and then breaks. Use Apify, which maintains purpose-built scrapers for Instagram, Facebook Ads Library, Google Trends and YouTube, and let Claude Code call them.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I make the output look like my brand",
    a: "Screenshots, not a brand document. Put four or five screenshots of your existing posts in a reference folder in the project. The model looks at them and matches the palette, the type and the general feel far more reliably than it follows a written description of your brand.",

    q: "What is the highest value marketing use case to start with",
    a: "Competitor ad analysis. Facebook's Ad Library is public and shows how long each ad has been running, which is the closest thing to free conversion data anyone will ever give you. An ad running for four years is working, and knowing that costs you one prompt.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I give Claude Code instructions by voice",

              One folder that holds who you are, who you sell to and what you look like, so every marketing task starts from your business instead of from nothing.
            </Answer>
            <p>
              The mistake I see people make with AI and marketing is treating
              every task as a fresh conversation. You explain your company
              again, paste your brand colours again, describe your audience
              again, and you get a competent generic answer again.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the opposite. You build <strong>one folder</strong> that
              knows what your business is, what it looks like and who it sells
              to, and every task after that starts from there. The setup is ten
              minutes and it is the whole difference.
            </p>
            <p>
              The example I used is a real estate company in dubai, but nothing
              here is specific to property. Swap the website and the reference
              screenshots and the same five things run.

                this, and it is the same information wearing a disguise. One

              That is the entire stack. Two keys in a <Code>.env</Code> file. The
              reason it is so small is that Claude Code writes whatever glue is
              needed between them, per task, rather than you assembling a
              pipeline in advance.

              These are close to what I actually said, dictated rather than

              <li>
                <strong>Direct scraping.</strong> Covered above and worth
                repeating, because it is the single most common way to lose an
                afternoon.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>A project with no context.</strong> Skip the website and
                the screenshots and everything it makes is generic. It will
                still be fluent, which makes it worse, because fluent generic is
                harder to notice.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Asking for five things in one prompt.</strong> One task
                per run. The results are better and you can see which part went
                wrong.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Trusting the first ad analysis.</strong> Ad longevity is
                a strong signal, not proof. A big company can run a bad ad for
                years out of inertia.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Publishing without reading.</strong> Everything here is a
                first draft with good bones. Your name goes on it.
