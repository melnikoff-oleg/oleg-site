Either you did not open a fresh terminal after installing, so the window does not know about the new command yet, or you installed the VS Code extension rather than Claude Code itself: the extension keeps a private copy for its own panel and does not give you the terminal command.

It has your files, it can run commands, and it checks its own results, so the output is a changed folder rather than text you have to copy somewhere.

            <Answer>
              Claude Code is Claude with your files open. It runs in a terminal,
              it works inside whatever folder you start it in, and instead of
              telling you what to do it goes and does it, then checks whether
              what it did worked.
            </Answer>
            <p>
              The name is the problem. It says code, so everyone who is not a
              programmer assumes it is not for them, and that is wrong in a way
              that costs people a lot. <strong>Most work that is not coding is
              also files and commands.</strong> A folder of transcripts. A
              spreadsheet of leads. Two hundred images that need renaming. A
              script that calls an API and writes the result somewhere. All of
              that is exactly what it is good at.

              <strong>1. Context is the product.</strong> The quality of what you
              get back is decided almost entirely by what it can see. Naming the
              three files that matter beats letting it search the whole folder,
              and it is cheaper. Carrying an old conversation into a new problem
              makes the answers worse, not better, which is what{" "}
              <Code>/clear</Code> is for.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2. <Code>CLAUDE.md</Code> is where you stop repeating
              yourself.</strong> A file in the folder that it reads every
              session. What this project is, how you want it done, the rules
              that are not obvious. Anything you have explained twice belongs
              there instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3. Plan first on anything that matters.</strong> Ask for
              the plan before the work. You get to correct a paragraph instead of
              a day of edits, and it is the cheapest review you will ever do.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>4. It is a delegation habit, not a typing habit.</strong>{" "}
              The failure mode is treating it like autocomplete and staying in
              the loop for every keystroke. The win is handing over a whole job,
              going and doing something else, and reviewing the result. That
              feels wrong for about a week and then it does not.
            </p>
            <p>
              Past those four there are skills (reusable instructions it loads
              on demand), sub agents (separate workers for separate parts of a
              job), MCP servers (connections to outside services) and hooks
              (things that run automatically at certain points). None of them
              matter until the four above are habits.

            <p>
              Every guide below is a real system I run, written out in full so
              you can rebuild it without watching anything. They are the answer
              to &quot;fine, but what do I actually do with it&quot;.
            </p>
            <ul>
              {CLUSTER.map((c) => (
                <li key={c.href}>
                  <a href={c.href}>{c.label}</a>: {c.note}
                </li>

              And if the job is a document rather than a repository,{" "}
              <Link href="/claude-cowork">Claude Cowork</Link> is the other half of
              the same plan.

          <GuideSection title="The mistakes everyone makes first">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>installing the VS Code extension and expecting the{" "}
                <Code>claude</Code> command.</strong> The extension keeps a
                private copy for its own panel. Install Claude Code itself.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Not opening a fresh terminal after installing.</strong>{" "}
                The old window does not know about the new command.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Expecting the free plan to work.</strong> It installs and
                then will not sign you in, which reads as a bug and is not one.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Letting one session run all day.</strong> The
                conversation becomes input on every turn, so it gets slower,
                more expensive and less accurate at the same time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Skipping permission prompts to go faster.</strong> The
                prompts are the only thing standing between a misunderstanding
                and a deleted folder. Read them until you have a feel for it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Never writing a <Code>CLAUDE.md</Code>.</strong> The
                most common one, and the most expensive.
              </li>
