          This is the step that decides whether cowork is useful to you or a

          folder you choose and inside the services you connect, so the output
          is a file in the right place rather than text you have to move.

          Under settings, connectors, you can add Google Drive, Slack, microsoft
          365, and anything that exposes an MCP server. For my own work the
          useful ones are drive, for where the writing lives, and Apify, for

  {
    q: "What are Claude Cowork use cases",
    a: "The ones that pay for themselves fastest are the recurring ones: a scheduled weekly metrics readout built from your own sources, first-pass review of a folder of documents against a checklist, reconciling exports into one spreadsheet with the variances flagged, and turning a folder of call notes into a memo on where each deal stands.

            <Answer>
              Cowork is the part of the Claude app where you hand over a job
              instead of asking a question. Chat gives you an answer you then
              have to do something with. Cowork goes and does the something,
              inside your own files and your own tools, and comes back with the
              finished thing for you to check.
            </Answer>
            <p>
              The practical difference is that the output is a file in the right
              folder rather than text in a window. No copying out, no pasting
              in. That sounds small and it is the whole thing.
            </p>
            <p>Three properties are worth knowing before you try it:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>It works where the work is.</strong> A folder you point
                it at, and services you connect: Drive, Slack, Microsoft 365,
                anything with an MCP server.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>It shows every step.</strong> The files it opened, the
                tools it called, the choices it made. You can follow along from
                anywhere and redirect it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>It keeps going when you stop.</strong> Close the laptop
                and the task continues. Put it on a schedule and it runs
                unattended.

              not a purchase decision.

              usage, not features, and you will know you need it because you

sources: the youtube analytics export in Marketing/YT,
and the posting log in Marketing/Channel-tracker.

compare every number to the week before.
flag anything that moved more than 15% either way,
and say in one line what you think caused it.

one page. save to Marketing/Weekly with the date in the filename.
if a source is missing, say so at the top instead of guessing.`}</Block>
            <p>
              That last line matters more than the rest put together. Without
              it, a missing file becomes a confident number that is wrong, and
              you find out three weeks later.

              In rough order of how much time each one gives back. All of them
              are recurring, which is the pattern: cowork earns its keep on the
              job you do every week, not the one you do once.

                <strong>The monday readout.</strong> Pull the week&apos;s
                numbers from their sources, compare to last week, flag movement,
                save the doc. Scheduled, so it is done before I open the laptop.

                <strong>First-pass review of a folder.</strong> Point it at
                twelve documents and a checklist, get twelve memos back saying
                where each one departs from the checklist and by how much.

              <li>
                <strong>Reconciling exports.</strong> Four regional CSV files
                into one summary tab with the variances flagged, plus a note on

            <p>
              Three features that turn a single useful run into something that
              runs your week.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sub agents</strong> are specialised agents that take a
              piece of the task end to end. The practical effect is
              parallelism: while one drafts, another researches and a third
              organises. If a run feels like a queue, this is the thing you are
              missing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Schedules</strong> run a task on a cadence, unattended.
              Daily, weekly, monthly. This is where the compounding is. A task
              you have to remember to trigger is a task you will stop doing in
              three weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Plugins</strong> bundle skills, connectors and sub agents
              into one install, so cowork shows up already knowing a domain
              rather than being taught it every time. There is a marketplace,
              and organisations can run private ones.

          <GuideSection title="What it is bad at">
            <p>
              The parts nobody puts in the launch post, from actually running
              it:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>It is not fast.</strong> A browser task is look, decide,
                click, look again. That is fine when you walk away and
                infuriating when you watch.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Vague goals produce confident nonsense.</strong> The
                failure mode is not refusing, it is inventing something
                plausible. Name your sources and tell it to say when one is
                missing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The first run of anything needs reading.</strong> Budget
                for that. By the third run you can stop.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage limits are real.</strong> A long unattended task
                on Pro can hit them mid-run. That is the actual reason to move
                to Max, and it is the only reason.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Anything that automates a platform you do not own is
                your risk, not Anthropic&apos;s.</strong> Automating LinkedIn is
                against LinkedIn&apos;s terms, and using Claude to work around
                another platform&apos;s terms is against Anthropic&apos;s usage
                policy too. Automate the research, send the message yourself.
