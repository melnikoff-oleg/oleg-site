// file on the site (about 47 kB on every cold visit) and it rendered almost
// nothing: `font-sans` appeared exactly twice in the whole codebase, once being
// the <body> tag below, because every element specifies font-display (DM Sans)
// or font-body (Space Grotesk). Removing it takes roughly 45% off the font
// payload and changes nothing anyone can see. --font-sans now points at the
// body face, so text that specifies no family inherits the one the design
// already uses for body copy. Guarded by tests/e2e/perf-budget.spec.ts (83).
