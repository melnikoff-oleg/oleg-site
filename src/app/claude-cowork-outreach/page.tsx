          Claude Cowork is Anthropic&apos;s desktop app. It is not a chat window
          that gives you advice, it is Claude with hands on your own computer. It
          takes a screenshot of what is on screen, decides where to click, and
          clicks.

          or Max. The free claude.ai plan does not include cowork, so it will
          install perfectly and then refuse to let you in.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also needs a browser to reach LinkedIn, and this is the one thing
          that has changed since I filmed the video. Cowork now ships with{" "}
          <strong>A browser built into its own side panel</strong>: nothing to
          install, separate from your tabs and your logins. You sign in to
          LinkedIn once per session, or import your cookies so it stays signed
          in.

          built-in browser: it is fewer moving parts and it does not take over
          the window you are working in.

      <>
        <p>
          Apify is a marketplace of scrapers. You point one at a source and it
          gives you back structured rows. For B2B the one worth using is an{" "}
          <Out href="https://apify.com/store?search=apollo">apollo scraper</Out>,
          which pulls founders, CEOs and job titles out of linkedin along with
          emails where they exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make an account, open settings, integrations, and copy your API token.
          Then connect it inside cowork:
        </p>
        <Block>{`settings -> connectors -> browse connectors
search "apify" -> apify mcp server
install -> enable -> configure
paste your api token -> save`}</Block>
        <p>
          This is the step that changes the shape of the whole thing. Without
          it, you export a spreadsheet and feed it in by hand. With it, you can
          say &quot;find me 100 marketing agency founders in europe&quot; and
          cowork runs the scraper itself, gets the rows back, and starts working
          through them.

          What you will see: it opens the profile, reads the top of the page,
          scrolls to the activity feed, reads each post and writes down what it
          learned, then drafts. Then it presses add a note, pastes the message,
          and sends.

          It is not fast. It is doing screenshot, decide, click, screenshot
          again. That is the point. You are not sitting there watching it, you

          read the table. You kill the bad ones. Then you tell it to send.

            <p>
              Claude Cowork is Anthropic&apos;s desktop app, and the difference
              between it and a normal chat is that it has your computer. It
              takes a screenshot of the screen, works out where to click, and
              clicks. So &quot;do my LinkedIn outreach&quot; is not a metaphor.
              It opens the profile.
            </p>
            <p>
              The loop it runs for one prospect is the same loop you would run
              by hand, and it looks like this:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Open the profile and read the headline and about section</li>
              <li>
                Scroll to their activity and read the last ten posts, noting
                what each one is about
              </li>
              <li>
                Write a message that refers to something specific they said
              </li>
              <li>
                Press add a note on the connection request, paste the message,
                send
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              It is slow, maybe a minute or two a profile, because every step is
              look then act. That stops mattering the moment you stop watching
              it. The whole reason to build this is that the research is the
              expensive part and the research is what you hand over.

              scrapers. you pick one, give it parameters, and it hands back
              rows. for B2B the useful one is an apollo scraper, which pulls
              people out of linkedin by role, industry and location.
            </p>
            <p>A run returns, for each person:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Name and job title</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
              It is not only for LinkedIn. The same marketplace has scrapers for
              Instagram followers of a given account, and for local businesses
              off Google maps. If your buyers are not on LinkedIn, the rest of
              the system still works, you just change the source.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the Apify connector is installed in cowork, you do not export
              anything. You ask for the leads in the chat and it runs the
              scraper, reads the rows, and can build a spreadsheet out of them
              before it starts writing.

              Fifteen minutes, and none of it is code. If you only read one part
              of this page, read step five.

            <p>
              This is the shape, not a magic string. The parts in capitals are
              the parts you have to replace, and they are the parts that decide
              whether it works.

            <Block>{`i sell WHAT YOU SELL to WHO YOU SELL TO.
the thing that makes us different is ONE SENTENCE.

for each linkedin profile i give you:
1. read the profile and the last 10 posts
2. write down what this person is actually working on right now
3. write a connection note under 300 characters that
   refers to something specific from their posts
4. make the compliment slightly awkward rather than polished,
   the polished version reads as generated
5. put the message in a table, do not send yet

when the table is done, stop and show it to me.`}</Block>
            <p>
              The last two lines are the ones people delete and then regret. See
              below.

          <GuideSection title="Why the messages get replies">
            <p>
              The reason is not that an AI wrote them. It is that almost nobody
              reads ten posts before sending a connection request, and the
              message shows it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The deliberate part is the <strong>slightly awkward
              compliment</strong>. Everyone&apos;s inbox is now full of
              perfectly balanced, perfectly polite, perfectly generic messages,
              and that polish has become the tell. Asking for something a little
              uneven produces something that reads like a person typed it,
              because a person would have.
            </p>
            <p>
              The other half is the checkpoint. A message that goes out without
              you reading it is a message you cannot stand behind, and in a
              small market you only get to do that once.

              <li>
                <strong>It is slow per profile.</strong> A minute or two each,
                because it is screenshotting and deciding. Fine in the
                background, painful if you sit and watch.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>It works one page at a time.</strong> The built-in
                browser is a single surface, so a run is a queue, not a swarm,
                unless you explicitly split it across sub agents.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>It will happily send something bad.</strong> If you skip
                the table step it has no way of knowing the message missed.
              </li>

                <strong>Automating LinkedIn is against LinkedIn&apos;s
                terms</strong>, and using Claude to get around another
                platform&apos;s terms is against Anthropic&apos;s usage policy
                too. There is no published safe daily number and every figure
                you find online is somebody guessing. The version I would
                actually recommend is to automate the research and the drafting,
                which is where the hours go, and press send yourself.

          One thing makes every outreach system convert better: before anyone
          replies, they check your LinkedIn profile. If it shows a real
          expert, reply rates climb. <BoldaneLink /> builds that presence for
          founders, from one hour of talking a week.
