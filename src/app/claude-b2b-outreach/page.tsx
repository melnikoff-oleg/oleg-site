        <p>
          A request carrying a message reads as a sales approach before anyone
          has decided whether they like you, and it gets accepted less often. A
          bare request costs the other person nothing to accept. You are buying
          the right to send a real message later, and that is worth more than

          Copy that search URL and give it to a sales navigator scraper on{" "}

          apparent buying power. Yours will be different and that is the point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then have Claude score all of them one to ten against those factors,
          using an Apify LinkedIn profile scraper to read each person&apos;s
          posts, about section and work history rather than guessing from the
          CSV.

        <Callout title="Expect to iterate here">
          <p>
            My first scoring pass did not reflect what I actually valued. It
            took a few rounds of reading the scores, disagreeing, and saying why
            I disagreed, before the numbers matched my judgement. That is not a
            failure of the system, it is the system working: you are extracting
            a rule you already had but had never written down.

          This sounds cosmetic. It is not. Filtering to score eight and above,
          and seeing that 143 of 600 were disqualified outright, is what makes
          the next stage affordable. You are about to spend real effort per
          person, so the list has to be short and it has to be right.

          In my case the gift is an improved LinkedIn profile: a new banner, a
          better profile picture, sharper headline text.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trick is teaching it what good looks like before asking. I give it
          several well-packaged profiles, including my own, and ask it to{" "}
          <strong>read the images and work out what makes them
          work</strong>: what the banner communicates, the visual hierarchy,
          where the social proof sits. Then it applies that to each lead.
        </p>
        <p>
          The images come from an image model (I use kie.ai for this). The
          output lands in the same dashboard, so you see the original profile
          and the improved one side by side before anything is sent.

Instead of asking for a call, it says your LinkedIn packaging could convert better, here is an improved version, take it for free, and attaches a genuinely good banner and profile picture made for that person. That is very hard to ignore and costs the recipient nothing, so the reply is easy.",

  {
    q: "Should I send a note with the connection request",
    a: "No. Send the request empty. A request carrying a message reads as a sales approach before the person has decided anything about you, and gets accepted less often. A bare request costs them nothing. You are buying the right to send a real message once they have accepted, which is worth more than getting a pitch in first.",

    q: "How do I scrape LinkedIn sales navigator leads",
    a: "Build and save the search in Sales Navigator, filter it to first-degree connections, then copy the search URL into an Apify Sales Navigator scraper along with your LinkedIn cookies, which a Chrome extension exports for you. It returns a CSV with headline, about section, company and profile URL for every result, and that file goes into your Claude Code project.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this the same as clay",
    a: "It does the same job: enrich a lead list and score it. The difference is that this is a folder you own, so you can change the scoring rules by saying what you want rather than fitting your thinking into someone else's interface, and you pay for the scraping rather than for a platform. The trade is that nobody supports it but you.",
  },
  {
    q: "How automated is this really",
    a: "About 95%, and the last 5% is deliberate. Finding, scoring and drafting are handed over. Deciding who is worth the effort and reading the message before it goes are not. This system does more work per prospect than a human would, not less, which is the whole reason it gets replies.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many leads do I actually end up messaging",
    a: "Far fewer than you scrape, and that is the point. From 600 connections, 143 were disqualified outright and only the ones scoring eight or above were worth a personalised asset. The value of the scoring stage is not the leads it finds, it is the ones it stops you spending an hour on.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will LinkedIn ban me for this",
    a: "Automating LinkedIn is against LinkedIn's user agreement, and using Claude to work around another platform's terms is against Anthropic's usage policy too. There is no published safe daily number and anyone quoting you one is guessing. The lower risk shape, and the one I would recommend, is to automate the research, the scoring and the drafting, which is where all the time goes, and send the messages by hand.",

              Here is the message that started the conversation with a prospect
              I will call bob, and the reason the whole system exists:
            </p>
            <Callout title="What the message actually said">
              <p>
                Your LinkedIn profile packaging is not converting as well as it
                could. Here is an improved version. Take it for free.

                Attached: a professional banner, a better profile picture and
                sharper headline text, all made for him specifically.
              </p>
            </Callout>
            <p>
              He replied &quot;sure, sounds good, here is my email, send it
              over&quot;. That is a conversation started, from cold, with no
              pitch in it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reason it works is not that AI wrote it. It is that{" "}
              <strong>it costs the recipient nothing to say yes.</strong> A
              normal cold message asks for fifteen minutes before you have given
              anything. This one hands over something good and asks for nothing.
              At that point replying is the path of least resistance.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the thing that makes it possible at any scale is that the
              asset is generated, so doing it for eighty people costs about what
              doing it for one used to.

              Scraping 600 people is easy. The expensive resource is your

              disqualified outright</strong>, on wrong country, wrong company
              size, or no sign of ever having bought anything like what I sell.
              That is 143 personalised assets not made and 143 conversations not
              started, which is hours back.

          <GuideSection title="The honest part about automating LinkedIn">
            <p>
              The most upvoted question under my outreach videos is whether this
              gets you banned, so here is a straight answer rather than a
              comfortable one.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Automating LinkedIn is against LinkedIn&apos;s user
              agreement.</strong> And using Claude to work around another
              platform&apos;s terms is against Anthropic&apos;s usage policy
              too. Those are both true regardless of how careful you are.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am not going to give you a safe daily number, because LinkedIn
              does not publish one and every figure you find online is somebody
              guessing. I am also not going to hand out ways to avoid detection.
            </p>
            <p>What I would actually do, and what I recommend:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Automate the research, the scoring and the
                drafting.</strong> That is where the hours are, and none of it
                touches LinkedIn&apos;s automation rules.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Send by hand.</strong> It is a few minutes a day for a
                list this short, and the list is short precisely because the
                scoring worked.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Keep the volume human.</strong> The entire premise here
                is depth per prospect. If you are sending hundreds a day you
                have rebuilt the thing this was meant to replace.
              </li>
            </ul>
