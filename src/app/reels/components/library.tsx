   * reaching the bottom cannot spin, cannot fail and costs no second embedding.
   * 800px of rootMargin means the next row is drawn before the last one has been
   * read, which is the difference between one long wall and five pages.
   *
   * The sentinel is only in the tree while there is more to show, so the
   * observer stops existing at 120 rather than sitting there firing.
