            The first video takes longer than every one after it, because it
            downloads its renderer once. A short reel is a few minutes; a long
            one with captions and music can be fifteen. The clock beside the
            editor is counting real work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every cut is kept. The little row of versions under the picture is
            your history, and clicking one plays it.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a video finally looks right, press <UI>Save this style</UI> and
            name the look. After that you can ask for it by name on completely
            different photos.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also paste a link on the left, a product page or an article,
            and it will read it and build from it.
          </p>
          <p>
            No music? The <K>music</K> folder ships empty, because licensed
            tracks are not mine to hand out. Drop your own <K>.mp3</K> files in
            there. The studio can also go and find music, stock shots and voices
            for you, which needs one extra sign-in; ask Claude Code to set up the{" "}
            <K>heygen</K> command when you want it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anything else: paste the error at Claude Code. It wrote the setup, it
            can read the error.

        <p>
          This is the whole deal: it is slower than a human editor at the

          This is the correct mental model for the whole thing: it is a first
          draft from an editor you are giving notes to, not a render you either

          Pick one, then build the rest. Iterating on five seconds costs almost
          nothing. Discovering you hate the captions after a thirty-minute

On Pro at $20 a month, roughly 20 to 32 videos, which works out at three to five a day against the daily limits. On the $100 tier, roughly 50 to 160. On the largest plan, roughly 200 to 320. Complex videos cost more than simple ones, so these are ranges rather than quotas.",

  {
    q: "Is the output as good as a professional editor",

  {
    q: "Can it make a video with no footage at all",
    a: "Yes. One of the examples I show started from nothing but a link to a landing page: it read the site, took the screenshots, the styling and the real reviews, and built a motion-graphics ad out of them. You can also just describe a motion-graphics video and get one with no materials at all.",

              A local app that hands your clips to Claude Code and lets you direct the edit in sentences, the way you would brief a human editor.

              Three panels.{" "}
              <strong>Left: everything you have.</strong> Clips, photos, a
              voiceover, music, dropped in unsorted.{" "}
              <strong>Middle: a sentence saying what you want.</strong>{" "}
              <strong>right: the edited video.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The thing that makes it work is the part you do not do. You never
              describe your footage. It watches every clip, works out what is in
              it, transcribes anything spoken, and decides which two seconds of
              a thirty-second take are the ones worth keeping.
            </p>
            <p>
              So the instruction can be as short as &quot;make a good video out
              of these&quot;, and that is a genuinely different interaction from
              every template-based editor, where you are still the one deciding
              what goes in slot three.

              <strong>A storytelling reel about moving to paris.</strong> I gave
              it a pile of photos, a few music files and a voiceover, and said:
              use the voiceover as the storyline, stitch the visuals so they
              make sense against it. It matched the b-roll to what was being
              said, beat by beat. Photos in that example, but video works the
              same way and it cuts the parts that are not relevant.

              <strong>A product ad from a single link.</strong> The materials
              panel contained one thing: a URL to a landing page for a travel-day
              tracking app. It read the site, pulled the screenshots, the visual
              style and the real reviews, and built a motion-graphics ad out of
              them. One prompt, no assets.

                This is not the standard of a top-tier editor and I would not
                pretend it is. The comparison that matters is not against a
                great editor, it is against <strong>the video you were not
                going to make</strong> because you could not afford one or did
                not have two hours. Against that, it is not close.

              Because you are spending plan usage, the real question is how many
              videos a plan buys. Roughly:

              The difference between people who get something postable and

            <ol className="guide-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Style five seconds before you build sixty.</strong> Ask
                for four variations of the opening: font, caption style, music.
                Pick one. Then build. This saves more time than everything else
                here combined.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Save the style when you like it.</strong> One button. It
                becomes a skill and every future video starts from your look
                rather than from default. You pay the styling cost once.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Expect versions, like with a person.</strong> V1 is a
                first draft. Give notes, get v2. Anyone expecting the first
                render to be finished is going to be disappointed by a human
                editor too.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ask it when you are stuck.</strong> The app is running
                inside Claude Code. &quot;how do I use a saved style&quot; gets
                an answer in fifteen seconds, which is faster than asking me in
                the comments.
