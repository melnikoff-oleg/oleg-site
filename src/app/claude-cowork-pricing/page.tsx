    q: "How much does Claude Cowork cost",

    q: "Is Claude Cowork worth it",
    a: "It is worth it if you have a recurring task where the inputs are files and the output is a document, and you do it at least weekly.

              <strong>No.</strong> Cowork needs a paid Claude plan. The free
              account gives you chat, web search, projects and file uploads, and
              it does not give you cowork. The app installs fine and then will
              not open it, which is the single most common confusion about this
              product.

              The honest signal to upgrade is not a feature you want. It is a
              task stopping halfway. Max buys usage, not capability: the same
              cowork, the same connectors, the same browser, with five or twenty
              times the headroom, higher output limits, priority at busy times
              and early access to new features.
            </p>
            <p>You are ready for Max when:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A scheduled task regularly fails to finish inside your limit</li>
              <li>
                You run several sub agents in parallel most days, which multiplies
                usage rather than adding to it
              </li>
              <li>
                You are working through folders of documents rather than single

          <GuideSection title="The API is not a cheaper cowork">
            <p>
              A question I get often: can I skip the subscription and pay per
              token instead? For cowork, no. The API sells you model access, not
              the app, the connectors, the scheduler or the browser. There is no
              pay-as-you-go cowork.
            </p>
            <p>
              The rates are still worth knowing, because they are what
              enterprise usage is billed at and what you would pay if you built
              your own version of any of this:
