Copying the mechanism, an open loop, a reveal held to the end, a specific hook shape, does not, any more than using a chorus makes a song derivative.

              It works out why the videos winning in your niche held attention, then writes new concepts that use the same mechanism on your topic, while the format is still working.
            </Answer>
            <p>
              The system tracks creators in your niche, pulls their
              best-performing recent videos, works out{" "}
              <strong>why each one worked</strong>, and writes new concepts that
              use the same mechanism for your own subject. In the run I show,
              the videos it found ranged from over 20 million views down to
              niche ones in the low hundreds of thousands.
            </p>
            <p>
              This matters more on TikTok than anywhere else, because TikTok is
              the platform where a format spreads fastest and dies soonest. The
              same hook shape carries a dozen creators in a fortnight and then
              stops working. Being three weeks late is the difference between
              riding it and looking like you copied.
            </p>
            <Callout title="What is being copied, exactly">
              <p>
                Not the topic. The <strong>mechanism</strong>: the hook shape,
                the way tension is held, where the payoff sits. That is the
                transferable part and it is not anyone&apos;s property. If the
                output reads like a rewrite of somebody&apos;s video, your
                generation config is too thin.

              Everything else is plumbing. These decide the output. Here is
              roughly what mine says:

            <Block>{`ANALYSIS
for each video, tell me:
- the hook, word for word, and why it stops the scroll
- the retention mechanism: what holds attention past second five
- the call to action, if any, and where it sits
- the structure, beat by beat

take the mechanism from the video, not the topic,
and write three different scripts applying it to our subject.
include b-roll direction for each shot.`}</Block>
            <p>
              The phrase &quot;take the mechanism, not the topic&quot; is doing
              a lot of work there, and it is the line I would not cut.

          <GuideSection title="Why three scripts per idea">
            <p>
              I ask for three concepts per source video rather than one, and the
              reason is not that more is better.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>You cannot judge one script in isolation.</strong> Read a
              single option and you either film it or you do not, and either way
              you are guessing. Read three framings of the same idea and the
              best one is usually obvious in seconds, because you are comparing
              rather than evaluating.
            </p>
            <p>
              The marginal cost of the extra two is a few cents. The marginal
              value is that you stop filming things you were lukewarm about
              because they were the only thing on the table.

                <strong>A stale window.</strong> The most damaging setting.
                Widen it past 30 days and you get depleted trends presented
                confidently.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>A thin generation config.</strong> Then it summarises
                instead of translating, and the output is somebody else&apos;s
                video with your words on it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Creators who are too big.</strong> A 20 million view
                video from an account with 30 million followers may have worked
                because of the account. Mix in mid-size creators where the idea
                had to carry it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The Gemini cap.</strong> A large run hits it. Fewer
                creators per run, not a bigger plan.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reading it as a to-do list.</strong> It is a shortlist.
                Three or four usable ideas out of a run is a good run.
