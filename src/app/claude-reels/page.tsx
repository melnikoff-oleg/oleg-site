// Oleg's two real configs, transcribed from the video (JhtbnZUU_8E, around

// button and the displayed text can never drift.
//
// One character changed: an en dash in "THE SHORTER THE ANALYSIS - THE BETTER"
// became a comma, per the site-wide no-dash rule. Nothing else is edited.
const ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `# CONCEPT
Overall description of the concept of this video, and what makes it valuable and interesting (1-3 sentences).
-> Clarify the core tension: what belief is challenged, what mistake is exposed, or what outcome is promised.
-> One clear idea only. No subtopics.

# HOOK
Detailed description of the first 5 seconds of the video, what makes it scroll-stopping and attention-grabbing, why a viewer needs to stop to watch it (1-3 sentences).
-> Break it down into:
- VISUAL (what is seen in the first 1-2 seconds: movement, facial expression, contrast, pattern break)
- TEXT (short on-screen statement: danger, promise, or contradiction, max 6-8 words)
- AUDIO (first spoken words: confident, direct, no intro, no context)
-> The hook must create either fear of loss, strong curiosity, or identity relevance.

# RETENTION MECHANISMS
Detailed description of how the creator manages to retain viewers throughout the video (1-7 sentences).
-> Open loops ("In a second I'll show you why...", "Most people miss this part...")
-> Delayed payoff (main insight is intentionally held back)
-> Micro-escalations every 3-5 seconds (new angle, sharper wording, visual or tonal shift)
-> Pattern interrupts (pauses, emphasis, cut, zoom, gesture)
-> Clear forward momentum: the viewer feels the video is going somewhere.

# REWARD
Describe the ultimate value that the viewer gets by watching this video (1-3 sentences).
-> Be explicit: what does the viewer now understand, feel, or see differently?
-> Define whether the reward is Education (clarity), Entertainment (emotional release), or Inspiration (self-belief / action).
-> The reward should feel proportional to the time invested.

# SCRIPT
Describe the full script of the video (1-20 sentences, as many as needed).
-> Structure:
1. Immediate hook (no greeting)
2. Problem framing / tension escalation
3. Why this matters (stakes)
4. Main insight or shift in perspective (this comes AFTER retention is established)
5. Clean close (no rambling; optional CTA only if natural)
-> Include: scenes, actions, voiceover, exact wording if possible.
-> Keep sentences short. Spoken language only.

OVERALL RULE:
THE SHORTER THE ANALYSIS, THE BETTER.
If it can be said in fewer words, it should be.
Clarity > cleverness.
Retention > information.`;

// The concepts config, with the client-specific lines replaced by capitalised
// placeholders. The shape is exactly what is on screen in the video.
const CONCEPTS_PROMPT = `Adapt this video for WHO YOU ARE: WHAT YOU DO, WHO YOU SERVE, WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT IN ONE OR TWO SENTENCES.

Task:
Give us 3 NEW video concepts inspired by the ORIGINAL reference.
Do not copy the original.
Translate the core idea into the CONTEXT OF YOUR NICHE AND YOUR AUDIENCE.
MAINLY iterate and sharpen the HOOKS.

Focus:
- First 3 seconds must stop YOUR BUYER from scrolling
- Hooks should challenge a belief, fear, or misconception they have
- Calm authority > hype
- Emotional credibility > performance
- No shouting, no buzzwords, no exaggeration

The output should have this format:

# CONCEPT 1
Text description (1-3 sentences)

## HOOK
Detailed hook description (1-3 sentences)
Describe:
- What is seen in the first 2 seconds
- What is said in the first line
- Why this hook works specifically for YOUR AUDIENCE

## SCRIPT
Detailed script description (1-20 sentences, as many as needed)
Include:
- Scene flow
- Spoken text / voiceover
- Clear but understated payoff
- Subtle authority, not selling

          it. An account averaging 40,000 views on daily posting is a teacher.
          An account with 400,000 followers and 3,000 views a reel is a

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The concept.</strong> What is this video actually about, in
            one line.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The hook.</strong> The first three seconds, verbatim, and
            why they work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The retention mechanism.</strong> What stops you scrolling
            at second eight. An open loop, a visual change, a promise not yet
            paid.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The reward.</strong> What the viewer leaves with. An
            insight, a laugh, a number they did not know.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The script structure.</strong> How the thing is built, beat
            by beat.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Start smaller than that if you want. &quot;analyse the hook and the
          script&quot; is a legitimate first version, and you can ask Claude to

          months ago won a different feed than the one you are posting into

The only genuinely new skill is being willing to use a terminal.",

Apify gives $5 of credit free every month, Google AI Studio has a free Gemini tier, and the script writing runs through your Claude plan. In a normal month of a few pipeline runs the marginal cost is close to zero. Heavy use pushes you past the free Apify credit first.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many creators should I track",
    a: "Between five and ten to start, all in one niche. Fewer than five and you are copying one person's style rather than learning what the niche rewards. More than ten mostly costs you scraping credit for patterns you already saw. Add more once you know which ones are actually teaching you something.",

What this system takes is the pattern, the hook shape, the retention mechanism, and those are not anyone's property.",

  {
    q: "Will the scripts sound like me",
    a: "Only if you tell it who you are. That is what the concepts instruction is for: your niche, your offer, your audience, the way your videos should feel. Skip it and you get a competent summary of someone else's video. The system produces the structure. The voice is still your job, and the point is that you now have your judgement pointed at the right thing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why analyse the video instead of just the caption",
    a: "Because the caption is not why the reel worked. The hook is the first three seconds of footage, and the retention mechanism is a visual or structural choice you cannot see in the text. That is why the pipeline sends the actual video to Gemini rather than reading the post: the analysis is of what was on screen.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use this for TikTok or YouTube instead",
    a: "Yes, and that is the real lesson of the project. The pipeline is scrape, analyse, generate, and only the first step is platform-specific. Ask Claude Code to point the scraper at TikTok and it will. There is a TikTok version of this guide on the site that was built exactly that way.",

              Most advice about going viral is somebody describing what worked
              for them once. This replaces that with the actual data: it reads
              the reels that are winning in your niche <em>right now</em>, works
              out why, and writes scripts that use the same mechanism for your
              own topic.
            </p>
            <p>
              I built the first version in under thirty minutes with Claude Code, and the point of the video was never the app. It is that
              this shape of thing, scrape, analyse, generate, is now something
              you can build in an afternoon for whatever you happen to need.

              <p>
                This does not make you go viral. It removes the blank page and
                replaces guesswork with evidence, so the judgement you already
                have is pointed at something real. That is a big edge and it is
                not the same as a guarantee.

            <ol className="guide-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Tracks creators.</strong> You add Instagram accounts in
                your niche. It records followers, posting frequency and average
                views, so you can see who is worth studying.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scrapes their best recent reels.</strong> Top three from
                the last thirty days per creator, by default, through Apify.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Watches each video.</strong> The actual video goes to
                Gemini, not the caption. It comes back with the hook, the
                retention mechanism, the reward and the script structure.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Writes concepts for you.</strong> Claude takes each
                pattern and your own context and writes about three new
                concepts, with full scripts, in your niche.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Eight creators, three videos each, three concepts each: roughly 70
              scripts from one run that takes minutes and costs close to
              nothing.

              Pick accounts in your exact niche whose average views are far

              This decides more than the prompts do, and it is the step people
              rush. What I look for, in order:

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Same niche, not same size.</strong> A real estate broker
                should study real estate accounts, not general marketing
                accounts with better numbers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>High average views relative to followers.</strong> This
                is the tell for a creator whose <em>content</em> works, rather
                than one coasting on an audience they built years ago.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Posting often.</strong> More than a few reels a month
                means the recent-window filter has something to find.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Five to ten of them.</strong> Fewer and you are copying
                one person. More and you are paying to rediscover the same
                patterns.

              One prompt tells Gemini how to watch a reel, the other tells
              Claude how to turn what it saw into your scripts. Everything else
              in the project is plumbing.

            <p>
              These are the two configs from the video, not a cleaned-up
              version. The first one goes in the analysis field, the second in
              the concepts field. The second has the client-specific lines
              swapped for capitals, and those capitals are the only part you
              have to write.

              The last four lines do more work than the rest. Without them the

          <GuideSection title="Reading the output without fooling yourself">
            <Answer>
              Read the hooks column first and the view counts last. The top row
              is the most viewed idea, which is not the same as the best one.
            </Answer>

            <p>
              You get a table sorted by views, each row carrying the analysis and
              the concepts. The trap is treating the top row as the best idea. It
              is the <em>most viewed</em> idea, which is a different thing: a
              3.5 million view reel may have worked because of who posted it.

                Read the <strong>hooks</strong> column top to bottom first,
                ignoring everything else. Patterns show up fast, and they are
                the transferable part.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mark the three or four concepts I could film this week without
                needing anything I do not have.
              </li>
              <li>
                Throw away anything that only works because of the original
                creator&apos;s audience or face.
              </li>
              <li>
                Rewrite the hook in my own words before filming. Always. The
                generated one is a starting shape, not a line to read.
