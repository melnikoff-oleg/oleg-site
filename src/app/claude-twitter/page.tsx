  },
  {
    q: "Does every post need an image",

              The dashboard is two columns.{" "}
              <strong>Left: a competitor post that went viral. Right: your
              post, using the same structure on your own subject.</strong> Side
              by side, so you can see exactly what was borrowed and what was
              written.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of yours come with a generated infographic, some with a
              personal photo, some with nothing, because on X a plain text post
              is competitive and a feed where everything is packaged looks like
              a brand account.

            <p>
              I built this around a specific person: an agency owner selling
              conversion rate optimisation to e-commerce brands, who gets most of
              his clients from his personal profile.
            </p>
            <p>
              That is the case where X is unreasonably good. In certain B2B
              niches the buyers are on the platform, they are reachable without
              ad spend, and a personal account outperforms a company one. So the
              system is not built to make a feed that performs. It is built to
              make a feed that sells, which is why the generation config carries
              your offer and your buyer, not just your topics.

            <p>
              The honest question about any system like this is whether it is
              just copying. Here is the distinction, with a real example from a
              run.

              The second post is a real claim about a real field, made by
              someone who can defend it. It borrowed a sentence shape. That is
              the same thing every songwriter does with a chorus, and it is not
              the same thing as copying a song.

                If you read your generated post and it is really about the same
                subject as the original, the generation config is too thin. It
                should be impossible to guess which competitor post yours came
                from without the left-hand column.

            <p>
              The image key is the one people skip, and most of what this system
              produces is visual. Without it you get text and empty slots.
            </p>
          </GuideSection>

          <GuideSection title="The image mix, and why some posts have none">
            <p>
              Three kinds of post come out, and the ratio is deliberate:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Infographics</strong>, generated in your style, carrying
                the same idea as the text rather than decorating it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Personal photos</strong>, from your own library, so the
                feed has a face in it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Plain text</strong>, no image at all.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              X is the one big platform where a text-only post competes fine. A
              feed where every single post is packaged reads as a brand account,
              and brand accounts are exactly what people scroll past. The mix is
              the point.

                <strong>A thin generation config makes it a copier.</strong> The
                single biggest failure, and the one with a cost beyond bad
                content.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>It cannot see the thread.</strong> A post that worked
                because of what it was replying to looks like a standalone
                banger and is not.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Contrarian claims need backing.</strong> The structure
                that performs on X is often a strong statement, and the
                generated version will make one you may not actually be able to
                defend. Read them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Automated publishing too early.</strong> One config
                mistake becomes thirty bad posts under your name. Read
                everything for the first few weeks.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tracking accounts that are too big.</strong> A post that
                worked because 400,000 people follow that person is not a
                pattern you can borrow.
