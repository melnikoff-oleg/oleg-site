// else, so the real work is the writing; this file is the cheap part, a single
// index that says what is here and what each page answers, so a model that
// fetches one url gets the shape of the site instead of a nav bar.
//
// Generated from the same route list the sitemap uses, so it cannot list a page
// that does not exist.
