It turns twenty pieces of advice into a ranked list, so the thing you do first is the one that is high impact, likely to work and easy. Without it a report is twenty good suggestions you will never start, which is the same as none.",

    q: "Can I do this for TikTok or Instagram instead of YouTube",

  },
  {
    q: "Why was the first report not good enough",
    a: "Because Claude Code knew the data and not the business. The first version drew conclusions that were wrong about my niche or so obvious I already knew them. It took about ten rounds of me reading it and dictating detailed feedback, roughly thirty minutes of talking in total, before it was genuinely useful. The model supplies the analysis, you supply the judgement.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I give feedback faster",
    a: "Dictate it. A useful round of feedback on a long report is five minutes of talking and nobody types that. I read the report out loud, said which conclusions were wrong and why, and asked for deeper analysis in specific places. Voice is the reason ten iterations was thirty minutes and not an afternoon.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I avoid putting in titles",
    a: "In my case, the word free. I had a video reach 95,000 views with free in the title and thumbnail, and it brought in an audience that was never going to buy anything. The report caught it and it was right. Views are not the goal on their own, so tell the report what business outcome you want and let it judge against that.",

            <p>
              A report with twenty recommendations in it is a report you will not
              act on. So every action gets scored on three axes, one to ten,
              multiplied together:
            </p>
            <KeyFacts
              rows={[
                { label: "Impact", value: "Impact on views, subscribers and conversions" },

                { label: "Ease", value: "How easy it is to ship in your next video" },
                { label: "Score", value: "The three multiplied, each rated 1 to 10, so 1,000 is a perfect ten on all three" },

            />
            <p>
              Multiplying rather than adding is the right call, because it
              punishes a zero. A brilliant idea you are not confident in, or
              that would take three months, drops down the list where it belongs.

                The evidence it gave: &quot;generated over $5 million in
                revenue&quot; on a 2 million view video, &quot;94% profit
                margins&quot; on a million, &quot;$72,000 a month&quot;, &quot;$4
                million a year in profit&quot;. Not vague adjectives. Specific
                dollars.
              </p>
              <p>
                And then it turned that on me: I have real numbers I was
                underusing, and I was burying them. <strong>The credential line
                is the hook.</strong>

              That is the shape of a good output. Not &quot;improve your
              hooks&quot;, which is advice. A pattern, the evidence for it
              across several channels, and the specific thing I personally was
              getting wrong.

              In my niche that surfaced whatsapp automation: people clearly want
              it and almost nobody was making it. That is a very different piece
              of information from &quot;this topic is popular&quot;, because
              popular usually means crowded.
            </p>
            <Callout title="The reason this is hard to do by hand">
              <p>
                You can feel which topics are popular. You cannot feel supply,
                because you only see what the algorithm shows you, and the
                algorithm shows you the crowded ones. Counting requires actually
                counting.

            <ol className="guide-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Fear of being replaced.</strong> By a distance. This is
                the biggest driver in the AI niche and it is not close.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Making money.</strong>

              <li>
                <strong>Building something.</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Going viral.</strong> Last, which surprised me, since
                that is what half the content in this space is about.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              It also split my audience into segments and weighted them, which
              is the part that changed what I film:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>45% automation beginners looking for templates.</strong>{" "}
                The top videos there are template databases, and they have
                &quot;free&quot; in the title. Which is exactly the trap in the
                last section.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>30% content creators wanting viral systems.</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>15% B2B marketers needing automation.</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>10% AI SaaS builders.</strong> And it noted that build
                vlogs consistently underperform for them.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Those are four different videos. Knowing which one you are making,
              and that the largest group is not the group you most want, is the
              difference between a video that works and one aimed at nobody in
              particular.

              I have to be honest about this, because it is the part that gets
              left out of videos like mine.{" "}
              <strong>The first report was not good.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Some conclusions were wrong about my niche. More of them were
              things I already knew, said confidently, which is worse than
              useless because it feels like insight. I read it and thought: this
              is not it.
            </p>
            <p>
              What got it to the version I still use was{" "}
              <strong>about ten rounds of feedback</strong>, dictated rather
              than typed. I read the report and talked back at it for a few
              minutes each round: this conclusion is wrong and here is why, go
              deeper on this channel, you have not understood my audience, that
              part is obvious, give me something better. Maybe thirty minutes of
              talking in total.

              <p>
                If you asked the best operator you know for business advice, five
                minutes would get you nothing useful, because they do not know
                your situation. A day with them would change your business. The
                model is the same. It has the data and none of your context, and
                the only way to transfer context is to spend the time.

            </Callout>
            <p>
              Dictate the feedback. A real round is five minutes of talking, and
              nobody types five minutes of nuance. That is the entire reason ten
              iterations took half an hour instead of an afternoon.

            <p>
              The report has a what-to-avoid section, and it caught something I
              had been doing wrong for months.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had a video reach 95,000 views with <strong>the word
              &quot;free&quot;</strong> in the title and the thumbnail. Great
              number. It brought in an audience that was never going to buy
              anything, and it taught the algorithm to send me more of them.
              Claude&apos;s note was blunt: stop putting free in your titles, it
              builds the wrong association.
            </p>
            <p>It was right, and I would not have worked it out on my own.</p>
            <p>The general lesson, and the reason it found it:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Tell the report what business outcome you
                want</strong>, not just that you want views. Views and revenue
                are different targets and sometimes they point in opposite
                directions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Give it your own numbers</strong>, so it can see which
                of your videos brought the right people rather than the most
                people.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ask what to stop doing.</strong> Reports default to
                suggestions. The subtractions are usually worth more.
              </li>
