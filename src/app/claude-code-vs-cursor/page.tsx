Claude Code is an agent: you describe an outcome and review what changed, which suits handing over a whole task. If your work is not a codebase at all, Claude Code fits better because it is folders and commands rather than an editor.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between Claude Code and cursor",
    a: "Where you sit. In Cursor you sit in the editor and the AI comes to you; you accept or reject its suggestions as you write. In Claude Code you sit outside and delegate; it reads the files, makes the changes, runs the commands and reports back. Cursor keeps you in the loop by default, Claude Code takes you out of it by default, and that single difference explains almost every other one.",

  {
    q: "How much do Claude Code and cursor cost",
    a: "Both are $20 a month for the individual plan. Cursor also has a free Hobby tier with limited agent requests, and higher Pro+ and Ultra tiers. Claude has no free tier for Claude Code, but the $20 Pro plan also includes Claude Cowork, Claude Design and Claude Science, so you are paying once for several products rather than one.",
  },
  {
    q: "Claude Code vs codex, which is better",
    a: "Both are terminal agents with the same basic shape, so the honest answer is that the difference is the model behind them and the ecosystem around them rather than the interface. Pick based on which model you already trust for your kind of work, and which subscription you already pay for. Anyone telling you one is decisively better is usually selling something or benchmarking on a task that is not yours.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Claude Code worth it if I am not a developer",
    a: "Yes, and it is the case people miss. The name says code, but the thing it actually does is read and write files and run commands, and most non-coding work is also files and commands: transcripts, spreadsheets, image folders, scripts that call an API. Every system on this site was built with it by someone doing marketing. An editor like Cursor has much less to offer that work, because there is no codebase to sit inside.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between Claude and Claude Code",
    a: "Claude is the chat: you ask, it answers, you go and do something with the answer. Claude Code is an agent with your files: it does the thing and the output is a changed folder rather than text to copy. Claude Cowork sits between them, handling whole office tasks like documents and spreadsheets. All three are included in the same $20 Pro plan.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use Claude Code and cursor together",
    a: "Yes, and plenty of people do, because they solve different halves. Cursor for the hour where you are writing something delicate by hand, Claude Code for the job you would rather hand over and review. There is a Claude Code extension for VS Code and JetBrains if you want the agent inside an editor rather than in a terminal.",

              Almost every comparison in this space is really one distinction
              wearing different logos. Some of these products put the AI inside
              the place you work. Others put the work inside the AI.

            <p>
              This matters because it predicts who is happy. People who like
              being in control of every line find agents unnerving. People who
              want their afternoon back find editors exhausting. Neither is
              wrong, and it is much easier to answer about yourself than to
              answer from a feature table.

              <p>
                My work is not a codebase. It is folders of transcripts, lead
                spreadsheets, image pipelines and small scripts that call an API.
                An editor has almost nothing to offer that, because there is no
                file I want to sit inside. An agent has everything to offer it.
                If your work looks like mine, this is not a close call, and if
                your work is writing an application by hand, it might go the
                other way.

            <p>
              These three are the same shape as Claude Code: an agent you talk to
              in a terminal that reads and writes files and runs commands. So
              the interface comparison people expect is mostly a non-comparison.
              What actually differs:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>The model behind it.</strong> The biggest real
                difference, and the one that moves most often. Whichever
                benchmark is winning this month will not be winning in three.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The subscription you already have.</strong> If you pay
                for one of these ecosystems already, the marginal cost of its
                agent is usually zero, and that is a stronger argument than any
                feature.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The ecosystem around it.</strong> Skills, sub agents,
                MCP servers, hooks, plugin marketplaces. This is where Claude Code is furthest along today, and it is the thing that compounds
                once you have written a few.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Open source or not.</strong> Opencode is open, which
                matters if you need to self-host, audit it, or point it at your
                own model.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              My honest recommendation: <strong>Do not choose on
              benchmarks.</strong> Choose on which model you already trust for
              your kind of work, and which subscription you already pay for. Then
              try the other one for a week in six months, because the ranking
              will have changed.

            <p>
              A comparison page with no downsides is an advert. The ones I run
              into:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Line-by-line control.</strong> If you want to see and
                approve every character, an editor is simply the right tool and
                Claude Code will feel like it is running away from you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The terminal is a real barrier.</strong> Not a technical
                one, a psychological one, and pretending otherwise does not help
                anyone. The desktop app and the VS Code extension exist partly
                for this.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No free tier.</strong> Cursor lets you try the shape for
                nothing. Claude Code does not, so the first{" "}
                {usd(PLANS.pro.monthly)} is a bet.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Long sessions drift.</strong> Usage and quality both
                degrade as a conversation grows. You have to build the habit of
                clearing between tasks, and nothing warns you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>It will confidently do the wrong thing.</strong> So will
                all of them. The difference with an agent is that it does more of
                it before you look, which is why plan mode exists and why you
                read the diff.

              <li>
                <strong>Is your work a codebase?</strong> If no, you want an

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Do you want to review lines or results?</strong> Lines
                means an editor. Results means an agent.
