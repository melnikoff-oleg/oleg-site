    q: "Can it use my own photos in the posts",
    a: "Yes, and this is the part that makes the output look like you rather than like stock. Put your photos in the context images folder with one clear face shot named me.jpeg, and ask Claude to rename them descriptively using that shot to identify you. It then picks a photo that fits each post instead of reaching for the first one.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why not just use ChatGPT to write posts",
    a: "Because a chat window cannot see what is trending in your niche this week, cannot generate the infographic, and cannot hand you a dashboard of finished posts. Claude Code calls a scraper for the trends and an image model for the visuals, and writes the output to files. The gap is not writing quality, it is that one produces text and the other produces posts.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does it know what is trending in my niche",
    a: "Through Apify, which has purpose-built scrapers for TikTok, Instagram, YouTube and Facebook. Claude Code calls them, reads what is performing right now, and writes from that. Asking Claude Code to scrape those sites directly does not work: the platforms block it, which is exactly why a service like Apify exists.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will the posts sound like me",
    a: "They start closer than you would expect, because the project reads your existing posts first, and they still need your pass. Treat the output as ten strong drafts with your topics and your evidence in them, not as ten things to publish. The time saved is in the blank page and the visuals, not in the final judgement.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the folders in the project for",
    a: "They are the brain of the thing: context about you and your audience, reference images for the visual style, example copy worth imitating, and skills for specific jobs like writing hooks or building carousels. You never have to open them. They are what makes the chat interface produce something specific instead of something generic.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does it cost per batch of posts",
    a: "A Claude plan at $20 a month covers the thinking and the writing. The variable cost is scraping and image generation, and it is small: Apify gives $5 of free credit a month and images are cents each. A batch of ten posts is well under a dollar of generation once you are set up.",

            <p>
              This is the honest question and it has a specific answer. A chat
              window can write you ten posts right now. It cannot:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>See what is trending in your niche this week.</strong>{" "}
                That needs a scraper, and platforms block direct scraping, which
                is why Apify exists.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Put your face in the image.</strong> That needs a photo
                library it can look through and an image model it can call.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hand you a dashboard.</strong> That needs somewhere to
                write files and the ability to build the page.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Claude Code does all three because it has a folder and can call
              other services. The difference is not writing quality. It is that
              one ends with text you then have to act on, and the other ends
              with the posts.

              This is the detail people miss and it is worth its own section,
              because it is the difference between content that is obviously
              generated and content that looks like you made it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Put one clear photo of your face in the images folder, named{" "}
              <Code>me.jpeg</Code>. Then ask Claude to rename everything else
              using it as the reference.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two things happen. The model learns which person in a group photo
              is you, so it never picks an image where you are not the subject.
              And the filenames become descriptive, so when it writes a post
              about a move to a new city it can reach for the photo that fits
              instead of the first file in the folder.
            </p>
            <Callout title="The same idea, generally">
              <p>
                Anything you want the system to use well needs a name it can
                reason about. <Code>IMG_4471.jpg</Code> is invisible.{" "}
                <Code>orange-sofa-laptop.jpg</Code> is a decision it can make.
              </p>
            </Callout>
            <p>
              You can see this working in the output. Every post comes with an{" "}
              <strong>image notes</strong> block underneath it, naming the exact
              file it chose and why:
            </p>
            <Block>{`## Image Notes
Personal photo: \`oleg-selfie-at-desk-imac-night-city-lights-dubai-highrise.jpeg\`
Vibe: casual, unpolished, matches the "imperfection" message.
Real desk, real setting, not a photoshoot.`}</Block>
            <p>
              And for a generated one it names the reference, the content and the
              style instead:
            </p>
            <Block>{`## Image Notes
AI infographic using \`reference/infographic-ref-3.jpeg\` (vertical flowing path).
Content: "From Voice to Published Post", vertical flow showing
Speak -> AI Processes -> Draft in Your Voice -> Quick Review -> Published.
Side-by-side time comparison: Old Way (90+ min) vs New Way (16 min).
Style: cream background, lime green accents, brand banner.`}</Block>
            <p>
              This is the part worth stealing even if you never use the project.
              A post and its image are one decision, so the system that writes
              the post should be the one that picks the picture, and it should
              have to say why.

                <strong>Skip the context step and it is generic.</strong> The
