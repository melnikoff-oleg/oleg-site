    q: "Is Claude Code included in Claude pro",

    a: "Only if you hit Pro's usage limits, which happens if you run it most of the working day or run several instances at once.

            <Answer>
              <strong>No.</strong> Claude Code needs either a paid Claude plan or
              an API account with credit on it. The free claude.ai account does
              not include it.
            </Answer>
            <p>
              This catches almost everyone once, because the install works
              perfectly and then the sign-in refuses you. Nothing is broken. The
              plan is the missing piece.
            </p>
            <p>There are exactly two ways to pay for it:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>A subscription</strong>, from {usd(PLANS.pro.monthly)} a
                month, which is a cap: you cannot get a surprise bill, you can
                only run out.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>An API key</strong>, billed per token, which is a meter:
                you pay for exactly what you use and there is no ceiling.

              Read that next to {usd(PLANS.pro.monthly)} and the case for a

              costs when it is metered. On Pro or Max the same usage is capped
              at the plan price, and the only thing you can run out of is
              headroom.

              My own use, running marketing systems rather than a codebase, sits
              well inside Pro. The sessions are shorter and the context is
              smaller than a developer working in a large repository all day.

          <GuideSection title="The four things that drive the bill">
            <p>
              If you are on the API, or hitting limits on a plan, it is almost
              always one of these four. In order of how much they matter:
            </p>
            <ol className="guide-list">
              <li>
                <strong>How much context you send.</strong> The single biggest
                lever, and the one people ignore. A session pointed at three
                files costs a fraction of one where Claude has read the whole
                repository. This is what <Code>/clear</Code> is for.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Which model you pick.</strong> Sonnet 5 is{" "}
                {usd(API_RATES[2].input)} in and {usd(API_RATES[2].output)} out.
                Opus 5 is {usd(API_RATES[1].input)} and {usd(API_RATES[1].output)}
                . That is more than double for work where the cheaper model was
                already right.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>How long the session runs.</strong> Usage climbs through
                a long session because the conversation itself becomes input on
                every turn. Starting fresh on a new task is cheaper than
                continuing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>How many instances you run.</strong> Sub agents and
                parallel sessions multiply usage rather than adding to it. This
                is the usual reason a Pro plan suddenly is not enough.
              </li>

          <GuideSection title="How to spend less without working slower">
            <p>
              The ones that made a real difference to me, roughly in order of
              effect:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Run <Code>/usage</Code> once a week.</strong> It shows
                plan usage bars for subscribers and session cost for API users.
                You cannot manage what you have not looked at.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Clear between tasks.</strong> <Code>/clear</Code> when
                you move to something unrelated. Carrying an old conversation
                into a new problem costs money on every turn and makes the
                answers worse.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Name the files.</strong> Telling it which three files to
                look at beats letting it search, twice over: cheaper and more
                accurate.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Use the smaller model for routine work.</strong> Most
                editing, renaming and boilerplate does not need the top model.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Put standing instructions in a skill, not in every
                prompt.</strong> Anything you paste more than twice belongs
                somewhere it is loaded once.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Set a spend limit on day one if you are on the
                API.</strong> The console supports it and it is the difference
                between a bad afternoon and a bad month.
