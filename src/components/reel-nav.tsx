/**
 * The two doors into the reel library, on every one of its pages.
 *
 * There were four until 2026-08-25 and three until 2026-08-27. "search" was a
 * search box over an empty screen and "library" was the same corpus listed under
 * two filters, which is two pages asking two halves of one question; the search
 * moved into the library and /viral-reels is a redirect. "ideas" was the chat
 * that turned a brand description into things to film, and it is gone. What is
 * left is the corpus from its two ends, on the two flat slugs it should have had
 * from the start. This is deliberately the only chrome either page carries: no
 * wordmark, no hero, no footer, because the whole point of them is that nothing
 * sits between a visitor and a reel.
 *
 * The order is the order of the questions: what reels are in here, and who makes
 * this kind of thing. Creators sits second because it answers a question about
 * the same corpus from the other end, and its own detail pages hang under it.
