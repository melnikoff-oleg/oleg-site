        <p>
          Installing the Claude Code <strong>extension in VS Code does not give
          you the <C>Claude</C> terminal command</strong>. The extension keeps a
          private copy for its own chat panel. That catches almost everyone, and
          it is not a broken setup.
        </p>
        <p>To get the command, install Claude Code itself:</p>
        <Cmd>
          {`# macOS or Linux
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Windows PowerShell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex`}
        </Cmd>
        <p>
          Then <strong>close the terminal window completely and open a new
          one</strong>. Skipping that is the second most common reason it still
          says not found. Check it worked with <C>Claude --version</C>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still not found on a Mac? Your PATH is missing the folder, so run these
          two lines:
        </p>
        <Cmd>
          {`echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc`}
        </Cmd>
        <p>
          <C>Claude doctor</C> prints a full health report if you are still
          stuck. And if you would rather never touch a terminal, the{" "}
          <A href="https://claude.ai/download">Claude Code desktop app</A> does
          the same job with buttons.
        </p>
        <p className="text-silver-muted">
          One thing worth knowing before you install anything: Claude Code needs
          a paid Claude plan (Pro or higher) or an API account. The free
          claude.ai plan does not include it, so it can install perfectly and
          still refuse to sign you in.

        <p>
          <strong>It is lowercase.</strong> Terminals are case sensitive, so{" "}

        <p>
          <strong>On Windows, <C>alias</C> does not define anything.</strong> In
          PowerShell <C>alias</C> means <C>Get-Alias</C>, which is why you get{" "}

          {`function cs { claude "/prime" }
function cr { claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "/prime" }`}
        </Cmd>
        <p>
          To keep those permanently on Windows, run <C>notepad $PROFILE</C> and
          paste them in.
        </p>
        <p>
          You never need the shortcut at all. Just run the thing it stands for:
        </p>
        <Cmd>{`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "/prime"`}</Cmd>
        <p>
          And read which error you get, because it tells you which piece is
          missing. <C>command not found: cr</C> means the shortcut is not saved.{" "}
          <C>command not found: Claude</C> after typing <C>cr</C> means the

          <strong>The API keys</strong> the pipelines use are pay per token,

          The free tiers genuinely cover trying this out: Apify&apos;s free plan

          That message is about the <strong>Anthropic API</strong>, which is

          subscription login. Check with <C>echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY</C> on a Mac.

          If you get a <strong>404 saying the model does not exist</strong>, that

          The honest version: in a project folder like this one, where you know

          Straight answer: <strong>There is real risk, and you should decide
          knowing that.</strong> Automating LinkedIn is not a grey area, it is
          against{" "}
          <A href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement">
            LinkedIn&apos;s user agreement
          </A>{" "}
          in plain words. LinkedIn says automated inauthentic activity can lead
          to temporary or permanent restriction of your account. In practice what
          people usually meet first is a block on sending invitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worth knowing too: Anthropic&apos;s{" "}
          <A href="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup">usage policy</A> forbids
          using Claude to get around another platform&apos;s terms. so driving
          LinkedIn this way is against both sets of rules, not just
          LinkedIn&apos;s.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thing that actually changes your exposure is{" "}
          <strong>whether your own logged-in account is doing the automated
          work</strong>. Reading public pages through a third party scraper does
          not put your account in the loop. A tool driving your session with your
          cookies does.
        </p>
        <p>So the lower-risk shape of this, and the one I would run:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>Automate the research: finding leads, reading public pages, writing the draft</li>
          <li>Send from your own account yourself, at a human volume</li>
          <li>Never point it at an account you cannot afford to lose</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-silver-muted">
          I will not give you tricks for looking human to LinkedIn&apos;s
          detection. People do post them, and following them is how you end up
          arguing with an appeal form. Do not quote a &quot;safe&quot; daily
          number either: LinkedIn does not publish one, and every figure you see
          online came from a vendor blog. What LinkedIn does say is what triggers
          it, which is more useful: a lot of invitations in a short time, and
          invitations that get ignored or marked as spam.

          This reads <strong>public</strong> posts through a third party scraper.
          It never logs in as you, never posts, never follows and never messages,
          so your own account is not the thing making the requests. That is a
          different risk profile from automating your own logged-in account, and
          it is the reason it is built this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worth being straight about the rest: Meta&apos;s and TikTok&apos;s terms
          restrict automated collection of data from their platforms, whoever is
          doing it. The practical exposure here sits with the scraping service,
