/**
 * One reel in the library wall: the thumbnail, big, and nothing else until the
 * frosted strip along its bottom.
 *
 * The same grid the creator profile uses, because that is the layout the eye is
 * already trained on and because it is the one Oleg asked for by name: a wall of
 * 9:16 stills at four to a row, hairline gaps, numbers laid over the picture
 * rather than beside it. The list of write-up cards this replaced gave a 50px
 * thumbnail four fifths of a card's width of prose, which is exactly backwards
 * for a page whose job is "Show me what went viral".
 *
 * FOUR numbers on the strip, at four sizes, in Oleg's order, because they are
 * not equally important and reading them as a row of equals is what made the old
 * strip slow:
 *
 *   1. views          the headline, twice the size of anything else
 *   2. outlier score  how far it beat its own creator's audience
 *   3. how long ago
 *   4. likes          smallest, because a like count is only ever read against
 *                     the view count above it
 *
 * The outlier score is here and deliberately NOT on the creator profile's
 * version of this tile. On one creator's page the audience is a constant, so the
 * score has nothing left to normalise; here every tile is a different account
 * and it is the only number that makes 400K from a small creator comparable to
 * 4M from a huge one.
 *
 * The handle sits above the strip rather than in it, and it is the one link that
 * does not go to Instagram: from a wall of many creators, "Who made this" is the
 * question the tile cannot answer without it.
 *
 * `index` is the tile's place in the wall and it decides only one thing: how
 * this tile asks for its picture. See src/lib/reels/paint-order.ts. It defaults
 * to the lazy end rather than the eager one, so a caller that forgets to pass
 * it costs a late picture and never stolen bandwidth.
