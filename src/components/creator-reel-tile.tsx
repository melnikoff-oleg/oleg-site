/**
 * The credit line: who else made this, and whether it was paid for.

 * Both are real facts about how a number was earned. A reel that did 28M views
 * as a paid partnership with a brand that pushed it, or as a collab posted to
 * two audiences at once, is not the same evidence as one that did 28M off the
 * creator's own following, and the grid gave no way to tell them apart. 819 of
 * the 24,252 reels here are declared ads and 3,405 carry a co-owner.
 *
 * Subtle, on Oleg's instruction, but visible: no fill and no colour of its own,
 * just an outline and an icon at the size of the date, on the bottom row beside
 * the smallest number. It is the fourth thing on the card and it looks like the
 * fourth thing. It truncates rather than wrapping, because a credit line that
 * took its own line on some tiles and not others is what made a grid of sixty
 * strips come out ragged.
 *
 * `sponsored` is tri-state and only `true` paints. false is Instagram asking and
 * the creator saying no; null is a row from a source that never carried the
 * field. Neither is a claim worth a badge, and painting them the same way is
 * the point -- they are both "Nothing to declare".

/**
 * One reel in a creator's grid: the thumbnail, big, and nothing else until the
 * frosted strip along its bottom.
 *
 * This is Instagram's own profile grid, because that is the layout the eye is
 * already trained on: a wall of 9:16 stills at four to a row, hairline gaps,
 * and the numbers laid over the picture rather than beside it. The old row
 * layout gave a 50px thumbnail four fifths of a card's width of text, which is
 * exactly backwards for a page whose whole job is "Show me what they make".
 *
 * Four things on the overlay, in Oleg's order and at four sizes, because on one
 * creator's page they are not equally important and reading them as a row of
 * equals is what made the old strip slow: views, then the date, then likes,
 * then the credit line. TWO FIXED ROWS, never a wrapping list, so every strip in
 * the grid is exactly one height whether or not it carries a credit. Views is the ranking (the audience is one constant
 * creator, so the outlier score has nothing left to normalise) and it is set
 * twice the size of everything else. Likes only ever qualify a view count, so
 * they drop to the date's size and the date's dimness.
 *
 * Still no outlier score, comment count or read/unread marker: those belong to a
 * page that ranks reels from different creators against each other.
