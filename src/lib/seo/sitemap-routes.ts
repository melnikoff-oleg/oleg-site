// Every static route on the site, with an HONEST last-modified date.
//
// Two bugs this file exists to kill.
//
// 1. The old sitemap stamped `lastModified: new Date()` on all 35 entries, on
//    every fetch. That tells Google every page changed within the hour, every
//    hour, which is not credible, so it discounts the field entirely and the
//    sitemap's one useful signal is thrown away. The dates below are real: they
//    come from when the page's files actually last changed.
// 2. /sam-altman-ai shipped without a sitemap entry and nobody noticed for
//    months, because the list was hand-kept prose with no check. A unit test now
//    reads src/app and fails if a route folder is missing from this list, so the
//    same gap cannot open again.
//
// When you change a page, update its date here. Nothing enforces the date's
// accuracy (nothing can), but a stale honest date is still worth more than a
// fresh dishonest one.
