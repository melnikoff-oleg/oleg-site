// The screen /reels opens on: 24 reels by the ten accounts in

// The wall used to open on the whole library ordered by outlier score, which is
// the right answer to "what went furthest" and the wrong first thing to show a
// visitor: the biggest outliers in this corpus are brain rot, and the first
// screen is what somebody decides the whole database is. A rule over the scores
// was tried first and rejected -- see the header of the accounts module.
//
// This is a DEFAULT, never a restriction. Nothing here narrows what the filters
// or the search can reach; it only decides what is on screen before anyone has
// asked a question.
//
// Kept out of browse.ts because that module is one PostgREST read of reel_search
// with no opinion about which rows matter, and stays that way.

 * and grouping in TypeScript rather than the other way round, because PostgREST
 * has no `distinct on` and a per-account query would be ten round trips.
 *
 * The same answer for every visitor and it only moves when sync.py runs, so it
 * is cached for a minute, in the running instance and in Next's data cache:
 * after the first visitor of the minute the default screen costs nothing at
 * all. It deliberately carries no count, so there is no number on screen that a
 * stale read could contradict.
 *
 * Returns an empty array rather than throwing on an empty result, so the caller
 * can fall back to the ordinary wall. An empty front page is the one outcome
 * worse than an ugly one.
