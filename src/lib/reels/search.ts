// Semantic search over the viral Instagram reels database.
//
// The corpus lives in Supabase (`reel_search`), one row per reel that has been
// watched end to end and written up as the five fields. It is built and kept
// fresh by `search/sync.py` in the reels-database repo, never by this site.
//
// A search is two hops: embed the visitor's words with the same model the rows
// were embedded with, then let pgvector rank the corpus by cosine distance in
// the `reel_search_match` function. Both hops are small, so a cold search lands in
// well under a second and a repeated one is served from memory.
//
// If the env vars are missing the module degrades instead of throwing: the page
// still renders and the search reports `configured: false`. That is what lets
// the Playwright suite run in an environment with no secrets.

// A build error, not a runtime one, if this module is ever pulled into a client
// bundle. It reads three secrets at import time, and the old /ideas board's
// data module (deleted 2026-10-24) was the proof this can happen by accident:
// its module-level env expression was visible in the shipped client chunk.
