// Single source of truth for the site's public routes, imported by every spec
// that iterates them (routes, design-tokens, mobile-overflow). Keeping one list
// means a new page can't be silently absent from half the suite.
//
// Four live routes are deliberately NOT here: /elon-musk-ai, /boris-cherny-ai,
// /claude-code-sessions and /claude-riemann-hypothesis. They are the filmed
// pages, ported in from the vault, and they render none of the shared shell — no
// header, no footer, no design tokens, and their own scoped ground — so every
// spec that iterates this list would fail on them for reasons that are the point
// of the pages. Adding one means teaching those specs to skip it; excluding it
// is the cheaper truth. (They are not link dead ends any more: each one whose
// video is live carries a FilmedPageOutro from its layout.tsx.)
